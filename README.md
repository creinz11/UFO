# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this project was to create a dynamic and fliterable site using JavaScript and HTML to easily sort through know UFO sightings provided in our data set. Over the course of this project we were asked to provide a site that could filter our data records based on Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. 


## Results
Users can expect to use this webpage in order to filter sightings based on specific criterias of interest. Based on our data.js file, users can filter based on Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. The left hand side of the page allows for user input that will dynamically pull in relevant sightings based on the values for each sighting record. While this site's main value is the ability to easily search esiting sightings in our data set, we are limited to data contained in our data.js file. To make this site more useful int he future, we should look to dynamically soure sightings, and leverage an API call to a source that is constantly being updated. This would allow us to keep our content fresh with the most up to date sighting information.
